# LibrarySystem

*Building*
The project uses Maven build system.
In order to create an executable jar package just call 'mvn package' in the project root directory.
Two jar packages will appear in the 'target' folder in case of successfull build, with and without dependencies in it.
It is recommended to run the one with dependencies to avoid problems with JDBS packages.
